\usage{
\method{interplot}{plot}(m, ylab = NULL, xlab = NULL, steps = NULL,
  point = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A data.frame recording the statistics of the changes caused by the interaction. The data.frame should includes four columns:
\itemize{
   \item fake: The sequence of \code{var1} (the item whose effect will be conditioned on in the interaction);
   \item coef1: The point estimates of the coefficient of \code{var1} at each break point.
   \item ub: The upper bound of the simulated 95\% CI.
   \item lb: The lower bound of the simulated 95\% CI.
}}

\item{ylab}{A character value to set the label of the y axis.}

\item{xlab}{A character value to set the label of the x axis.}

\item{steps}{A numeric value desiring length of the sequence. A non-negative number, which for seq and seq.int will be rounded up if fractional. The default is 100 or the unique categories in the \code{var2} (when it is less than 100. Also see \code{\link{unique}}).}

\item{point}{A logical value determining the format of plot. The function produces a point plot when it is \code{TRUE}; otherwise, the fucntion produces a line plot. Both plots have 95\% confidential intervals. The default is \code{FAULSE}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Graph based on the data frame of statistics about the conditional effect of an interaciton.
}
\details{
\code{interplot.plot} is a S3 method from the \code{interplot}. It can graph the interaction effects based on a statistic data.frame recording the effects in a numeric way.

Because the output function is based on \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}, any additional arguments and layers supported by \code{ggplot2} can be added with the \code{+}.
